        text:"The Persian is the most popular pedigreed cat in North America, if not the world. He first came into vogue during the Victorian era, but he existed long before then. Little is known about his early history, though.The Persian comes in two types: show and traditional. The show Persian has a round head enhanced with a thick ruff, small ears, a flat nose, big round copper eyes, a broad, short body with heavy boning atop short tree-trunk legs, and a thick, flowing plume of a tail.",

        text:"Drop-eared cats such as the Scottish Fold are not as unusual as they might seem. Spontaneous genetic mutations, such as curly coats or folded ears, occur in cats on a fairly regular basis, and the Scottish Fold is the result of such a mutation. All of todayâ€™s Folds descend from a Scottish fold-eared cat named Susie who was found by a shepherd in 1961.",

        text:"The British Shorthair is a study in roundness. He has a large round head, round eyes and rounded paws. Even his tail has a rounded tip. He was once known as the British Blue because he came only in that color, but these days his short, plush coat comes in many different colors and patterns.",
